# Face-emotion-Recognition-Using-CNN-and-Keras
I used FER 2013 dataset which contains 20,000 images which is available in kaggle
first run the trainemotiondetector.py which will takes nearly 4 hours to train the model then two files emotion_model.json and emotion_model.h5 will be stored in the system which contains all the training data and weights
run testemotiondetector.py to test the model.
